### AugLiChem Update

Additional functionality has been added.
`RotationTransformation` and `CubicSupercellTransformation` now support the additional option of adding a perturbation.
`TranslateSitesTransformation` has been reworked to randomly generate a translation vector.


An issue with `pytorch` version was found, and now `pytorch>=1.10` is strictly required.
