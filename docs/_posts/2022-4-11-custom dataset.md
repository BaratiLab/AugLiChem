### New features:

Custom data sets are now supported. Documentation in Crystal Usage has been updated.

HOIP data set has been added for automatic downloading.

Additional checks for data validity have been included. The additional `remove_bad_cifs` flag has been added for when augmentation does not produce a physically realizable cell. This happens to about 0.1% of files when it is an issue.
